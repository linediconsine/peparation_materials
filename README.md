#### Design concept
- KISS : Keep it simple stupid ( clean, simple code.)
- DRY : Do not repeat yourself 
- TDA: Tell don’t ask
 It reminds us that rather than asking an object for data and acting on that data, we should instead tell an object what to do. This encourages to move behavior into an object to go with the data.
- SoC: Separation of Concerns
- YAGNI: You ain’t gonna need it
- Solid Single responsibility principle,A class should only have a single responsibility, that is, only changes to one part of the software's specification should be able to affect the specification of the class.
- Open–closed principle "Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification."
- Liskov substitution principle "Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program." See also design by contract.
- Interface segregation principle _"Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface."_
- Dependency inversion principle _One should "depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions."_
